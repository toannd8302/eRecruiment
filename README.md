## The Recruitment Process: 
This is a brief description of the recruitment process

* Post job vacancies -> Job Application -> CV Evaluation(Pass/Fail) -> Interview -> Reports after interview -> Final Decision(Pass/Fail)

If CV fail, candidate will fail the job that he/she applied. If CV passed, candidate will get a interviewer schedule. 

Candidate or interviewer can reject their schedule but they have to write reasons for that rejection. 

After each Interview schedule, interviewers need to write reports for each candidate. HR Manager will base on that to give a final decision.

## Roles and features
* Department: Manage job postings (View/Create/Delete)
* Candidate: View Job Postings/Post Details, Apply job, View job applications, View schedules, Accepct/Deny interview schedule, ...
* HR Employee: Manage job postings (View/Accept,Deny/End), Manage job application(Evaluate CV, schedule,...), Manage interview schedule(Create,Start,...)
* Interviewer: Manage schedule (Accepct,Deny,End), Manage Report(Write/Edit Reports)
* HR Manager: View job applications, Make a final decisions(based on CV,reports)
